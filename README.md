## Features

### 1. Bias Simulation
Helps you determine what percentage of a chosen upgrade you're more likely to roll. Adjust the min/max upgrade range, bias multiplier, and quality to see the distribution of outcomes across any number of simulation attempts.

### 2. Upgrade Calculator
Given the waxes you plan to use, calculates the odds of hitting a specific upgrade on a beequip. Accounts for soft, hard, caustic, swirled, and debug wax counts, as well as your current upgrade slots and maxed-out upgrade adjustments.

### 3. Beequip Simulation
A 1:1 recreation of how waxing works in-game. After years of research and reverse-engineering the game's upgrade system, the exact waxing mechanics were pinned down to an extremely high precision — and this is the result. Apply waxes interactively and watch your beequip's stats update in real time, just like the actual game.
